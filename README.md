## Project Objective

This project aims to develop machine learning models for customer segmentation, helping businesses offer personalized wealth management services. By predicting customer behavior based on past interactions, businesses can gain insights into preferences and improve marketing strategies.


## Data

The sample dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders of a New York City bank over the last 6 months. The file is at a customer level with 18 (behavioral) variables.

## Algorithms

Five clustering algorithms will be used to perform segmentation. These algorithms are:

- [K-Means Clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html)
- [K-Medoids Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-medoids)
- [Agglomerative Clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html)
- [Spectral Clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering.html)
- [DBSCAN Clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html)
- [Gaussian Mixture Model-based Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model)
