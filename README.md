## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop machine learning models for customer segmentation, enabling businesses to offer personalized wealth management services to target customer groups.

Machine learning plays a significant role in predicting customer behavior. By analyzing patterns in past purchases and interactions, businesses can uncover valuable insights into customers' preferences, enabling more effective marketing campaigns.

Customer behavior refers to how consumers choose and use products, influenced by cultural, social, personal, and psychological factors. To understand and predict these behaviors, businesses employ predictive behavioral analytics and market research.

Utilizing these insights allows businesses to refine their marketing strategies and enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Data

The sample dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders of a New York City bank over the last 6 months. The file is at a customer level with 18 (behavioral) variables.

## Algorithms

Five clustering algorithms will be used to perform segmentation. These algorithms are:
